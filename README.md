This project involves the development of a machine learning classification model to assess mental health based on data collected from a Google Forms survey. 
The survey gathered comprehensive information, including demographic details (gender, age), current mental and emotional state, symptoms, coping strategies, and support needs.
Key survey questions addressed mental health conditions, coping mechanisms, stress management, and the presence of suicidal thoughts.
The machine learning model was designed through a series of steps: data preprocessing, label encoding, oversampling, feature selection, and handling of missing values.
Feature scaling techniques, such as standardization and min-max scaling, were applied to normalize the data. 
The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
Multiple classification algorithms were assessed to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting mental health status. 
The best-performing models were selected based on their accuracy and reliability. 
This approach enabled the development of a robust model capable of accurately classifying mental health conditions and providing valuable insights 
for mental health assessment and support.
